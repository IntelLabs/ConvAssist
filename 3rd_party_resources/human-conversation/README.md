> **Dataset Card**
> ### Context
> 
> I was working with RNN models in Tensorflow and was searching about conversation bots. Then a idea struck me as to create a bot myself. I looked for chat data but was not able to find something useful. Then I came across Meena chatbot and Mitsoku chatbot data and so compiled them with some data from human chats corpus.
> 
> ### Content
> 
> The data corpus contain chat labelled chat data with Human 1 and Human 2 in ask-reponse manner.
> Each odd row with Human 1 label is the initiator of the chat and each even row with Human 2 label is the response.
> Data after Human x: is the chat data which can be preprocessed to remove the label part.
