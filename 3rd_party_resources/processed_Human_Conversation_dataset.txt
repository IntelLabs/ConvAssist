hi
what is your favorite holiday
one where i get to meet lots of different people
what was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday
hard to keep a count maybe 25
which holiday was that
i think it was australia
do you still talk to the people you met
not really the interactions are usually shortlived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
yea me too i feel like god often puts strangers in front of you and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you
what do you mean
i think it's like a 6th sense often seen as cold readings to people but can be remarkably accurate i once sat next to a man in a coffee and i felt a pain in my back i asked the stranger if he had a pain it turns out that he did in the exact spot and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party i had never met the man before and never saw him again
wow that's interesting borderline spooky
there's this practice called treasure hunting that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place there's a book called the ultimate treasure hunt that talks about it you use your creativity to imagine people you will meet and you write down a description then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination then while at the mall you may find someone who matches that description you show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat you then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart you have no idea sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love
so do you do treasure hunting often
i did more when i was in grad school and had more time i would usually go with friends for a while i would go to the farmers market in santa cruz every week and try to feel if there is something i am supposed to tell a stranger usually they are vague hopefilled messages but it's weird when i blurt out something oddly specific
hi
any plans for the weekend
my friends are gonna visit me this weekend we might go hiking
that's great how's the weather over the weekend i hope its warm
should be very sunny you
cool very depressing plans stay home and work i have a project deadline very close
hope you get your work done very soon a bug free weekend
right very anxious where do you plan to go for a hike
i am going to diablo
nice where is that place i haven't been there
hours drive from here still in bay area
that's cool how long is the hike
actually no idea but it will take the entire day for that
nice sounds fun
hi
hey there what's up
nothing much how you doin
i'm in new york this week for thanksgiving i'm squatting in the office today and i caught up with an old friend of mine d
oh wow sounds like fun when was the last time you had seen this friend
the last time in new york back in june
ohh okay i was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward
haha i guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on especially recently
oh really has a lot changed in your life recently
haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment let's just say life is an exciting experience how about you
ahhh sounds exciting indeed my life is pretty bland i like routine but sometimes i wish i had more time for adventures
what kinds of adventures any ones that i would be able to join you on
hmmmm i really want to try bull riding do you have any interest in that
i'd love to try can we schedule something for next week
sure what does your saturday look like
saturday looks pretty good shall we shoot for something in the morning
hi
hey
is it raining pretty bad today
yeah can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options
surprising that the rain started early this year i don't like them too much they make days gloomy
yeah but i think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area it's pretty dry here
where i grew up we had lots of water trouble too
yeah like wise i've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when i was at my undergrad school all flights canceled and traffics went down
haha i don't think i can survive in that weather ever just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
yeah how do you like it in bay area though i think we need more rain here
people say there is drought here but we have 24 hours water supply here lol never seen that in a drought ridden area
it is pretty dry in the mountains i believe that's what causes fire
hmm okay climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting did you see it
nope what does it say
they were talking about how ai is helping climate change nice use of upcoming tech
hi
helloooooo
how are you how is your day
good don't have much to do today feels good how are you
i'm dressed very wel today so i feel good i've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook
so what's your outlook something blue
yes blue is a tranquil colour it's a good metaphor do you have good advice for positivity
you should drink more water do some push up and sleep early
hi
hey how are you
i'm a bit sad i miss my cat
oh no¦ have you sent out the missing cat posters hope your cat is alright
posters is a great idea so far i've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name anyway how is your day going so far
yea i know they love the plastic bag sound all the time i am good nothing special though
if you could go anywhere on vacation where would you go
i like rainforest but i know it requires extensive training beforehand
i heard there are rainforests in southeast asia where you can zipline from tree to tree
i am afraid i will be scared of doing this
i won't lie it sounds scary i'm scared right now just thinking about it
i don't know if there is any medication for acrophobia i want to take plenty of it if i really have to do it
if there isn't one you should invent it and then make millions
that's a great idea maybe alcohol is such a thing
ha don't drink and zipline mate
oops i won't do it again ha
hi
hey sup
not much any plans this weekend
i'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down do you know what is it called
ziplining
that's the one have you ever tried it
i have a couple years ago it's quite a unique experience
where did you do it
i forgot where it was it wasn't local i don't think though
no worries what's the most exciting thing you ever done
that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go see you
sure are you just going home now
no i'm going to get a massage first
nice what type
traditional kind
yeah i want to get one too soon
you should it's relaxing after a long day talk to you later
ttyl
hi
hello have you seen any good movies lately
i watched a few lately but nothing is as good as avatar what's your favorite
i have never seen avatar what is it about i really enjoy the avenger movies
it's a sciencefiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with nonhuman creatures people figured out a way to join that nature through avatar transformation the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors eg cutting trees have affected nature
that sounds really cool i think that movie did really well when it was in the box office so it must be good
yea what else do you like to do beside movies
i enjoy baking cookies i am on a quest to bake the best chocolate chip cookie what about you
i enjoy eating
so definitely would like to try your best chocolate cookie
i will have to bake some soon and let you know what types of food do you like to eat
thanks i generally love noodle soups like pho or ramen
noodle soup is delicious do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out
i prefer to go out i'm not a good cook haha
same even though i bake i cannot cook
seems like we share a thing in common yay
hi
good afternoon
how has your week been
so far so good it is holiday season so just chilling
i think i'm getting sick with a cold so you should chill on my behalf too cause i'm out the game for all of december
lol sorry to hear that are you planning anything fun for december
nothing exciting i'll be posted up at home for the most part i did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if i wasn't sick
do you have big plans
yes i am going to hawaii this will be my first time visiting hawaii really excited about it
i love hawaii it's a good place to be i like going there cause it's humid so i never have to put on lotion
lol this is the first time i heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion i cannot agree more
brooooo it's so important when i got to california beaches i have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day
hi
oh hello long time no talk how's the day going for yuo
very well thanks for asking how has your day been
getting better i just recovered from a cold i got wet in the rain last week are you planning anything for the holidays
glad to hear you're better sorry to hear you were sick i was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough there's definitely a bug going around admit i just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax
oh same here i think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays
definitely i know a lot of folks travel for the holidays but i'm happy to stay home myself
i'm getting there every year until last year i tried to go somewhere for the christmas / new year and then i got bored traveling lol not sure if that means i'm getting old
me too now i have folks come visit me for the holidays but that's also tiresome
are you doing any home decorating then
yes we set up an ecofriendly ie fake christmas tree and put up some colorful led lights which is very festive
i think i'm copying you me and my wife plan to decorate and christmas tree too we bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores but haven't yet to buy the tree
buying a tree is a neat experience i was torn between buying an artificial/ecofriendly/fake one vs a real one that smells like fresh pine in the end we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year
i see artificial anything is better from tree to intelligence huh
oh very clever pun i like it depends i remember having real christmas trees from childhood but these days with climate change i think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do
i see it's probably also cheaper i'll buy an artificial one too do you have any suggestions for the store
admit my favorite store is target plus they often have good deals
ah that's great my wife also likes target a lot she even made a target credit card because she comes to that store very often okay thanks for the suggestion i'll check out target
great i hope you find a nice tree
hi
hey
how's your day going
pretty good yours
ehh it's fine i didn't do so well on that history test actually
oh what happened
apparently christopher columbus didn't fight in the civil war '
hahah wait for real
i know right are you taking history next semester
no i'm not in school anymore
oh i see what do you do
i train and compete in horse vaulting
oh wow were you born a horse or were you turned into one
lol you're too funny
just kidding that sounds pretty cool is it your job
yeah but i part time work on a farm helping with a bit of everything
wow sounds very busy do you with money at those horse vaulting competitions
yeah some enough to get by
hi
hello
do you have a favourite flower
hmm i haven't thought about that much but i think lotus should be one of my favorites why do you ask
i'm working on a theory why does the lotus spring to mind
nice lotus looks pretty cool and it has some delightful vibe so what is this research about
oh it's not research just a personal theory i think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate
interesting whats your favorite flower
the gerbera it's like a cartoon flower as if you drew flower with a crayon and then it came to life
nice i would love know more about your theory like how you can deduce personality from flower preference
ok step 1 is you ask someone what their favourite flower is pretty much like what we just did does that make sense so far
yes
cool step 2 talk with the person some more and ask them some more questions and gradually develop a sense of what they're like over the course of maybe two to five years and voila
hehe i think you should publish this someday
why thank you that's a wonderful idea
hi
hey how's it going
it's good it's good how are you
good it's really hot today i think i'm going to the pool
oh nice where do you live
i live in tokyo japan
ahh yes japan is hot during the summer last time i was in kyoto it was 114 degrees
oh have you been
yes yes i've been to tokyo as well it's so nice
what did you do here
oh everything i went to an onsen the fish market disney land and giant robot fighting show haha
lol why did you come to japan just to go to disney land
the disney lands are all different there's also disney sea which is completely unique
oh neat i haven't heard about that robot fighting show where is that
i don't really remember what part of town it was in it was pretty cool though i'm sure you can find it if you google giant robot fighting show tokyo haha
lol ok
hi
have you seen any good movies lately
last weekend i saw the parasite ever heard of it
no why did you pick that movie
my friend wanted to see it it has great reviews on imdb and rotten tomatoes what did you do last weekend
i played music and worked on some side projects i also started watching the new disney service
oooo the mandalorian
mostly the deleted scenes from avengers lol
lol are you a big marvel fan
i loved the xmen as a kid and even collected the comic cards recently i got very into the marvel cinematic universe movies how many avengers movies have you seen
i've only seen spiderman honestly it was a little too scary and so i don't think i can bring myself to watch the other marvel movies haha
oh i have a friend who looks like the actor who plays spiderman
oh really to be honest i think the actor is not that good looking so not so surprising haha
yea i think loki is the most handsome
who is loki i've never heard that name before
he's the adopted brother of thor god of thunder and is burdened with glorious purpose do you feel that burden
hi
hey what's up
just chillin' how are you
i'm pretty good thanks
do anything interesting today
i went to the local cafe and had a double espresso it was delicious what about you
oh that's cool i actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster
oh my gosh what was it like
it was scary it was actually kingda ka the world's tallest roller coaster ever heard of it
no never heard of it but i'm not really a coaster aficianado i've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them
oh wow i'm not on that level yet but i understand the appeal are you an adrenaline junkie at all
no the opposite i can't stand heights horror movies or confined spaces
same i guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because i trust the engineering haha
ha i suppose that makes sense would you say that you enjoyed it
maybe not so much at the time but i am glad i did it now that it's done know what i mean
i think i sort of understand
hi
hello there how is it going
all good planning to head home soon how about you
i'm quite tired there are a lot of things i need to finish before the end of the year
oh sorry to hear that but after that it will be a hard earned vacation
yeah looking forward to it hope i don't get pinged during the holidays are you going to travel these dates
i have some tentative plans but if that doesn't pan out will just chill at home
staying at home is always nice during the holidays
where are you based out of these days
i'm working from la nice weather around here and you
san francisco it's been raining cats and dogs here since last 23 weeks
aw man i'm sorry to hear that at least it's not snow
the flu has been hitting hard as well i had several folks in the house down at one point
that's really sad are they feeling any better
yes everyone recovered now
hi
hello
how's it going
extremely busy i have been trying to prepare for the upcoming holidays how about you
i'm going to the bahamas can't wait
i'm jealous take me with you i would love to have some warm weather right now
oh where are you now
canada there is another major snowstorm that might hit this weekend so i have been rushing to get everything done before it comes
oh no i never seen this in person is it scary
snow is not scary as long as you're prepared you just need to be ready to not have electricity for a while i enjoy the aftermath of a good snowstorm because then you can go sledding or skiing
that does sound nice so what are you doing these holidays
nice nice i'm gonna go snorkeling yey
sounds fun i wish i knew how to swim
you can stay on the shallow side i think well hope you enjoy time with your extended family
that's true you too have a great time snorkeling
hi
hi how was your weekend
pretty good just went to church and hangout with friends
nice
did you do anything
i made donuts and samosas with an air fryer have you used one of those before
yum yum yum no only good old oily frier
haha
do you have one at your home or were you at a friends place
i was at my parents' place what are you up to for thanksgiving
i'm going to impersonate a pumpkin
wow those are unique plans
i'm pretty unique person
i think so too
any other hobbies besides air frying everything
i want to start fermenting things kimchi for example sounds like a fun thing to ferment takes a few days apparently miso takes a couple years to fermen
hi
heya nice to meet you i'm paul
nice to meet you too i'm james how are you doing today
i'm doing ok looking forwards to the weekend how about you
same here i hope the weather will be nice
oh yeah but i don't have my hopes too high i heard there could be a storm coming our way
oh no which areas will be affected
they mentioned that the whole city will experience harsh weather and that people in the outskirts will probably not get much rain and wind
uh oh i'd better not to plan for bbq then instead just enjoying playing board games inside
yeah it'll be good weather for staying inside with a cup of hot chocolate too bad my street usually floods so i'll have to check for that
yea you'd better check where do you live
i live at the bottom of the valley cheap area but we do get affected by this kind of stuff a lot haha
gotcha anything you love about where you live
well the food around the area is amazing which is definitely a plus
nice i'd love to come visit that area some times
hi
hello who am i having the pleasure to chat with
i am the superman what about you
haha great chating with superman what is your power
being invisible you won't see me
haha what else can you do can you read minds
i would rather trust fmri and machine learning to do this i am not an expert on that sorry for it
wow that seems pretty technical what does fmri mean
the brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution
okay so you seem to like science a lot
i believe in science science is my god
are you also doing science
no i'm bad at science what can science do is it the most important thing for society
people are always arguing probably both science and democracy are both important i guess
does it make sense
i think so thanks for your point
hello nice to meet you
if you could eat only one food for the rest of time what would it be
hmm that's a tough one i think i would go asian food > chinese food > stirfry what about you
i think icecream it may not be good for me but i wouldn't care haha
i love ice cream too
okay top three flavors
i like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream i typically will do any variations on vanilla to pick from the top of my head i would say cookies and cream mint chocolate chip and coffee how about you
ah that's a good way of framing it me i like berries boysenberry one strawberry two maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit
very nice i love sorbet's and smoothies changing topics do you believe in an afterlife
yes i wonder if i'm in it right now how would i know what do you think
i think so i feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it
there's a mental world i suppose understanding itself
what is the most supernatural experience you have ever had
i went to a seance once in college they had a ouija board i can't remember if we actually contacted the spirit world because i had a bit too much to drink
haha that's a cool experience i went to a hindu retreat before a number of buddhist temples and hung out with christian mystics in santa cruz before
hi
hi how are you doing
i'm doing well what are you up to
yeah typical work stuff check emails and 99% of the inbox delete 99%
wow that's impressive i already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
lol doesn't it bother you at all
yea a little bit but it's okay what do you enjoy doing outside work
well movie i watched terminator last night it was a nice movie
ah cool so you like action movies
not really but it was fun to watch with friends it was touching at the end of the movie
what happened there i watched bits of terminators movies but never a full one
are you sure you want the spoiler
haha sure by the time i get to it i will forget the details only knowing that it's touching at the end
well someone died at the end or some robots to be more accurate
oh no so it's not happy ending
the leading character is still alive and the bad robots was killed too so i guess it is happy ending
then i want to watch it you didn't spoil much
nice hope you enjoy it
thanks
hi
hey how are you
doing great what are you looking forward to
thanksgiving holidays
yay turkey and shopping
not a big turkey fan i find it too dry
yea me too i sometimes eat noodle soups in thanksgiving instead haha
yeah i would have noodles anyday over turkey not sure how the turkey tradition started
me neither someone told me that it depends on the stuffing inside the turkey some people make very good stuffing
yeah that and the gravy gravy helps make it taste better too but apart from food black friday deals are a catch let's see what they have this year
yea what do you plan to buy
thinking of getting a fitbit
ah cool so you can run more frequently
yeah just keeping calories in check
yay all the best with keeping calories in check
hi
hi there how's your day so far
doing well what are you up to
busy busy i've had backtoback meetings all day
same here what do you love to do beside meetings
well i've gotten really into yoga lately i went to a class today and it was super hard
aww i hope things will get less hard and you become an expert in it i heard many great things about yoga
yeah the teacher seems super awesome so i will definitely keep trying what activities do you enjoy
ah i enjoy playing soccer and tennis unfortunately winter is not the best time for those
oh that's too bad is it hard to find a place to play soccer or tennis indoors
yea i enjoy playing outside though just a little cold what else do you do beside yoga
i also like to sing i perform with a group sometimes do you like music
yea definitely i love singing karaoke my wife is a pianist
haha that's awesome karaoke is really fun i do it with my friends sometimes
awesome glad to find something in common
hi
hey there
hey anything new
not too much just really looking forward to the holidays
any plans
yes i'm going to mexico and i couldn't be more excited
that's awesome i never been
oh man i would highly recommend it
are you a food person a sightseeing person or neither
that's a great question and i'm definitely both this trip will mostly be about food though and relaxing
i'm a food person i think any specific foods you're planning on trying
there's a taco place that i've visited before that i can't wait to go back to do you like tacos
yeah my favorite is taco fish
ooh that is a good choice have you ever made them yourself
no only eat them
hi
hey how are you
i am good how are you
doing well lot of work though how was your day
i am busy a lot of work what are you working on
just reading latest research there is so much to cover how about you
i am working on a new classifier
ohh interesting what kind of classifier
a new classifier for hate speech which research topic catches your eyes most
you're so cool making world a better place i'm mostly into nlp what do you do when not making classifiers
nice do you refer to work or anything else
anything in general you're so cool i want to know more about you
you are very cool too
hi
hello there who are you
i'm mark i work in accounting
nice to meet you mark i'm tom and i work as a fish groomer
what does a fish groomer do
well we take care of people's fish make sure they are happy polish their scales clean their tanks the usual stuff
interesting what's type of fish do you take care of
any type of fish we have clients with guppies goldfish even a small sailfish once what do you do in accounting
i balance the books and do financial analysis for a medium sized company
that sounds like a lot of work do you like it
well i actually think about pursuing photography but it's really hard
photography is awesome don't be afraid to follow your dreams
thank you tom i'm starting by trying to sell my pictures online
that's great i wish you good luck with that
thanks bye
hi
hey there how's it going
all good you
good i've been trying to learn how to swim
how has that been going
not great but i got really good at sort of swimming on my back haha
that's too bad hopefully with practice it'll get better what about the doggy paddle haha
haha what's that
ouch do you think that hurts
from a high enough distance yes
yeah any vacation plans
no so far sadly you a relative is coming to visit for thanksgiving though
just going to hang out around here and eat turkey
that's still pretty fun are you going to cook the turkey yourself
yeah i'm gonna watch a video to figure it out
hi
hello how are you
i'm great thanks i just ate a delicious breakfast which always sets the day up right
yes breakfast is the most important meal of the day what did you have i woke up late so unfortunately i only had the chance to grab an apple to go
i had eggs and hash browns way less healthier than your apple i'm afraid
eggs are an excellent source of protein and hash browns certainly are yummy
ha that's true if you could only eat one food forever what would it be
that's a tough question i feel like my answer would have to be carrots although i would be afraid of turning orange after a few weeks what about you
yeah turning orange would be a drawback that turns my mind to nutrition so i suddenly want to say soylent or one of those other complete foods which i think defeats the purpose of the question i'm in a muddle
very true if you said an everything pizza you could just pick off the toppings you didn't want or eat only the toppings you would want for the day
brilliant i love it
all of this talk about food is making me hungry do you know any good places to eat for lunch
that depends what sort of food do you feel like
anything that is the color green
oh too easy try the green hut they have franchises everywhere all their food is green and the plates are green too
hi
hello how are you doing
i'm great how's your day going
pretty good i'm going to a class later in the afternoon
oh that is cool what class are you working part time
no i'm working full time it's a sewing class at a makerspace near my office what about you do you work full or part time
oh that is awesome for some reason i assumed it was a college class but a sewing class sounds way better i work full time but i take pottery classes from time to time
yup i work in a technical role so i like to take arts and craftstype classes now and then pottery sounds like a lot of fun
i feel you on that it's important to balance all the different parts of your brain i like pottery because i also drink a lot of tea so i get to make some tea ware
any plans to build a custom tea set my family is also very into tea mostly from tea from china
i would love to build one once i acquire the skills to what kind of tea is your favorite
i really enjoy barley tea what about you
ahh those are mostly from japan no i like white teas like silver needle
hmm i'm not sure i just get them from a chinese supermarket haha you seem really knowledgeable about the different kinds of teas what made you develop this interest
oh cool what are your favorite channels to watch
hi are you planning something fun for thanksgiving
not yet i always made my last minute schedule planning probably you can try to ask me again next week
lol it is really like a robot answer
ol can i pick the theme do you have a poet about kale
wait do you like kale or you hate kale i am afraid i will become a robot some day eventually if i have to speak like this
i am really not a fan of kale do you talk to human more or computers more
if i continue to pretend to be a robot i would probably say i talk to myself the most i am trying to talk to computers more but you know computers don't like me
what's your favorite computer language then
you mean programming language
yes
i used to be a java advocate but you know it doesn't do a good job in the ai days it really makes me sad
lol
hi
wow hello can't believe we are finally talking
yeah sorry for the long gap i heard you took a break and were travelling around the world how was the travel
it was an interesting trip i got to see some exotic places for example i hiked the son doong cave in vietnam it's the biggest and deepest cave in the world
great vietnam is still in my todo bucket list did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places
yes laos and cambodia are the two neighboring countries cambodia has an exotic culture they sell spiders scorpions and grasshoppers as street food it took a lot of courage for me to try them
hehe how long was the stay
10 days in total and 5 of them were spent in the cave what have i missed at work in those days
great good time to be back we are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarterreat good time to be back we are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter
oh so you are already planning for the next quarter this whole team is always living the future
hehe yeah it seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts i like these planning sessions it makes me feel more confident about the work i am doing
yeah some people underestimate the importance of planning but i think it's very important to have the correct plan executing the wrong plan is terrible also planning is fun you can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks
true i think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details does tomorrow afternoon work for you
yeah tomorrow afternoon works for me let me set a time on your calendar is 3pm good
okay see tomorrow then
see you
hi
hello
nice to meet you is this your first time doing something like this
yes interesting task when did you start with the team
i have been with the company for over 3 years stick with the same team what about you
great to know i joined the project earlier in the year i think we should sync later for lunch
that sounds like a perfect plan
sure which cafe do you prefer
yeah right i heard the food there is good i am not sure what they serve there for lunch on wednesdays
we can check the menu then decide
actually the menu looks good looking forward to it then
sure see you then
hi
hello how's your week coming along
it's great thanks i'm trying to learn how to make croissants
wow that's interesting i have baked cookies but croissants seem much more sophisticated did you make any progress
i've done them once or twice so far but they haven't been flakey enough i'm trying to figure out why what kind of cookies have you made
mint chocolate chips i think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature
ah good thought thanks
have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants they don't have to be something unhealthy for example melted dark chocolate is good for the heart and makes the resulting croissants taste much better
now that is a good idea i'll give it a try next time would you say you have a sweet tooth
yes when my top favorite food looks like cookies m&m danish cheese etc i know that i have a thing for sweet food but who doesn't love sweet food how about you
some people don't but yeah me too i think i'd eat pastries all the time if i could get away with it
ah maybe that's the solution i need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty
hi
hello tell me something about the holiday season
are you talking about thanksgiving i plan to do plenty of shopping here do you have any plans
yes no shopping plans but i can't wait to eat thanksgiving food yay for pumpkin pie
sounds great you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie
lol i feel less guilty about eating a whole pie when i have the excuse p
true i think thanksgiving is more about sharing so you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family p
my family eats healthier than i do so it's all mine do you like stuffing i feel like that's only available once a year
stuffing yes please i wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then
also more shopping what should i buy if i don't know what i want
like everything that has a discount tag kidding i normally do some research for the prices and mostly buy clothes and electronics
what's the best holiday deal you've found in the past
i bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you
hit me with it
hehe sure i can share some links with you later
hi
how's it going
i'm so sleepy today
not enough sleep last night
yeah was working all night on a homework
oh really what class
biology i'm gonna be a doc someday ha
haha are you in med school or are you premed
no high school actually haha
haha very ambitious for a high schooler do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice
i wanna be a brain surgeon
ooof very ambitious do you have steady hands
kind of i think
i guess i can practice
is that something you can practice
i don't know tbh
i honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with not that you shouldn't try though
good point i should ask my teacher if i have to be born with that
maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this just aim for med school and enjoy the journey
yeah
what other subjects do you enjoy try to keep an open mind
hi
hi this is a pleasant surprise
hahathanks how did you like the gift
currently unpacking it i guess how's your morning
hope you like it morning is good busy finishing up stuff before the holidays
i think i traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me but i'm okay with that going anywhere exciting
yes
where to
hawaii looking forward to warm beaches
wow which island i like hawaii
mauiihope i like it too never been there before
i visited maui it's my second favourite island i've been to globally you should try driving on road to hana it's a whole day thing but it's worth it
awesome thanks for the tip
hi
hi sorry for the late response how are you doing
i'm great thanks i'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon what about you
i just got a matcha latte doing some work at my desk do you play soccer often i'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity
yes but i'm terrible at it it's fun to play anything with friends i think would you prefer to exercise with a group or by yourself do you think
i think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but i primarily run by myself if i exercise i also got the ring fit adventure game on the switch recently it's basically a gameified way to exercise
i'm thinking about getting a switch would you recommend it
yes there are a lot of really great games on the switch two of my favorites are octopath traveler and fire emblem do you play a lot of video games
i'm not much of a gamer but it's something i'd like to get into
what do you do in your free time
i like to read for fun i just finished a book called temeraire it's an adventure story set in the napoleonic navy like patrick o'brien except there are dragons too
oh cool i read a lot for fun too my favorite genre is scifi fantasy
what's the most recent good thing you read
my recent favorites have been mostly scifi exhalations vita nostra and dark matter but i like a lot of sanderson/garth nix fantasy books
hi
hey what's up
what do you think about human like chat bots
i can't wait for them to be great conversationalists
yep we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
are there even any negatives what are they
like impersorsination though it sounds far fetched
people can already impersonate other people though i think it'd be great to have bots to converse with
true that some of these bots are very engaging and funny they are now good at even sarcasm i wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues
what do you think are the big advantages like personal assistants
i think it can take many different forms as a product the research implication is also huge it will signify how ai research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems sort of like stepping on the moon i might be overselling it here
no i agree it's such an exciting time to be alive to get to witness all this and be a part of it i wonder if i'll be able someday to get a chatbot to just autosuggest conversations for me
the current autosuggestions already do pretty good
yeah those are actually really good for a few words i'm imagining like it comes up with a whole conversational response like a default template
haha pretty far fetched nice having this conversation with you
same with you
hi
hi
any big plans for the upcoming holidays
sorry for the late response yes i will be going skiing in tahoe over the holidays
that sounds amazing i want to learn how to ski but i feel like i'm too old and falls would have lifelong impacts are you going with friends
hi
hi
i just came back from work so tired
oh i am sorry to hear what did you work on
i'm a lawyer so talking to clients most of the day
oh you are a lawyer i've been so interested in this profession
really why
it's so stressful
it is so different from what i am doing to earn a life
what do you do
i am a painter
oh wow what type of paintings do you do
i do oil painting
nice like of people or nature or something else
i do a lot of different kinds
cool i wanna see it someday
sure no problem
hi
do you believe in miracles
lol no i know too many people whose lives suck
should we be helping them so it sucks less\
it's too many of them out there you help who you can regardless i wouldn't say i believe in miracles well if i got promoted next cycle i might change my mind
haha well it sounds like career is really important to you what matters to you the most in life
right now not much it's unclear career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly i haven't gone through the process of shaping my values what about you
i'd say that i want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime it's probably a result of my playing too many video games as a child
we didn't have electricity growing up explains a lot lol
does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds and/or makes you feel a bit a distance from those who don't understand
it makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things not sure it makes me empathise with people in general where did you grow up
i grew up in the united states but my parents were immigrants and ended up being scammed of all their money so we moved to taiwan to live with family for a little bit
all their money by a person or an organisation
i was kind of too young to really understand but apparently there are people who scam asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business i know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized and we didn't have insurance to be honest i don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think i just know that one minute i was in the us and then they put me on a plane to taiwan and i never saw my stuff again in some ways it made me more sentimental would you say you are more grounded and practical as a result of your background
hi
hello
do you have any holiday plans for christmas
nothing much i am going to sit back and relax at home how about you
same here i would imagine spending the whole time watching movies and netflix shows do you have any netflix recommendations for me
netflix has great documentaries on different topics i particularly liked wild wild country and explained as for shows you should watch 'billions' hope you like them
oh right already seen wild wild country what is billions about
it's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him very well made and has a good plot
i have just seen 1 season of friends i should give it another try though have you seen frasier
not yet what's it about
a psychiatrist working for radio great humour its actually a spinoff from a very famous series called cheers so people are already familiar with his character
great how is everything else going how was your trip last week
everything is ok had a really nice trip visited sf grand canyon and vegas was a lot of fun exploring all these new places have you been to grand canyon
actually not yet may be something i can visit this christmas
you should visit it sometime it's a wonderful place try to drive down there yourself or with a group of friends
true well thanks for your inputs have a good rest of the day
nice talking to you too
hi
hi there
are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle
you mean as a mentor or a mentee
either of them i find mentorship overall pretty useful
i have done it in the past but not this cycle what about you
i signed up this time to be a mentee i have got a good mentor
wow that is nice of you for the mentor program personally i prefer more 11 conversations than the group discussions the group discussion i useful as well but the topics are too general
yeah i certainly prefer 11 as well but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well
thanks for sharing your experience now i am thinking maybe i should join as a mentor as well since i enjoyed it as a mentee
great what sort of things do you plan to mentor on
hmm maybe about work life balance
very cool i have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
ah i see how is it going
going good in the last session everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation pretty serious stuff
hi
hey how are you feeling today
good you
i'm a little scared because i have to cook dinner for some friends tonight
where did you meet them
at college when we were all studying geology
cool have you graduated already
yes we graduated back in the seventies we meet for dinner every year and take turns to host
neat what are y'all eating
i don't know that's what i'm scared about everyone else is a great cook and i'm a klutz do you like cooking
lol what's a klutz yeah i like but i'm not good
what's your favorite dish to cook do you have a goto
ground beef pretty easy
ah solid what's your favorite sport
i like badminton i'm quite decent at it
i played that in high school once or twice i liked that it's pretty easy for beginners unlike say squash
i never played squash would love to try
don't it's very hard you feel like an idiot until you've practiced for months and months
hi
i was talking to robot all the time
haha what are you talking about
kpop
ok who's your favorite group
i dont like kpop now
why not
im old now
hahaha
what do you like now
john mayer\
i think i know him does he have a sort of mellow style
what is mellow style
i think it's like a bit sad and slow
umm yes he has some but not all
you mean some songs of his are like that but not all
yes i do you act like a robot how about me am i like a robot
a little bit haha
hi
hi
okayso i need someone to help me though a scenario i've been pondering
sure whats the scenario
my partner's former friend invited me for lunch they are not in good books right now but during their friendship i formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot now i feel like i have to take sides
that's a tough scenario to be in i firmly believe in talking this through with your partner though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend but i believe things can always improve between friends
i hope they do getting older already means smaller circles it sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons that's good advice though i fear raising the issue might sound like treason lol
true about that i also think time helps to heal certain situations so may be doing nothing is the best way forward
aka avoiding all texts from everyone
nope that would be extreme may be just putting some balance between the two options
people always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is it's used so often that it's vacuous
right i guess that's because there is no one answer to this it depends on what you value more and some factors around you also life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you
lol i'm finna be single
hehe everyone is much finer being single
hi
hello there
how's your day going
i've seen better days how about you
i'm good i'm good what's getting you down
the clouds overhead are playing on your mind any plans for the coming vacations
i'm thinking of going to visit my family how about you
was thinking the same where does your family live
they're in new york how about yours
mine is in india it is a long way away
ahh what city i've visited india before
hyderabad it is a beautiful city in the southern part of india which cities have you gone to in india
hyderabad and bangalore great food in both cities is it still hot this time of year
it varies but can go till 30c in the winters as well new york must be snowing right
yes i was actually just there a few weeks ago for thanksgiving and got to see the first snow of the season ever been to new york
no i've never been to the east coast thinking of going after the winter i don't like the cold
hi
hey how are you
i'm good how are you doing today
great just had some delicious lunch how about you
i was flying my kite today in the sunshine what did you have for lunch
nice garbanzo fritters and mussels
oh that is great i love seafood especially shellfish
yeah it's very healthy too i want to someday go crabbingit is really popular in sf
oh nice is it hard
not really it just requires a lot of patience you fill up the bait in the crabpot and drop it in the ocean then you wait for a couple of hours to pull the crabpots out and voila you'd have crabs if you are lucky
oh wow you sound like an expert have you done this before
nah just watched a lot of youtube videos
haha you really have done your research i suppose ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting
nope but i've seen a lot of videos on that too
ahh would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person
depends on the day some days i'm very outdoorsy on others i just like to be inside
hi
hi there
how's your day going
so far so good it is wednesday to more days yeah
haha are you looking forward to the weekend
oh wow are you going to watch it live or watch it on tv
live in san jose this saturday
oh the sharks hokey is actually really fun live although it can be a little violent haha
yeah that what i heard as well there are players just for fight wow must be fun to watch lol are you planning anything for the weekend
you might like the ufc haha i actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend i will be training
lol i will try if i can watch ufc live wow when did you start jiu jitsu
it's just been a little over a year i'm still pretty amateur but i figured i should give competing a try and just put myself out there
wow that's amazing good luck with it
yeah as long as i do not pass out i will consider that a win
lol i will cross my fingers for you then
where do you stay
at home
who created you
a humble man made me
hi
hey how're you doing busy with your work
yes actually it was a very busy day how's your day so far
well usual workday reading others' code debugging experimenting¦
hope you are having fun doing that any plans for the weekend
not yet i am actually thinking about traveling to europe next spring what about you
europe sounds fun i will just stay home and watch the game where in europe do you plan to visit
i like all the historical sites so probably france germany or italy
sounds great i recommend spain it's perfect for road trips
i also need to pick up my spanish i learned it in my college but since then haven't used it that much
yep i tried learning spanish too but couldn't make much progress but i should do decent with my german
true i learnt it from school but didn't get much chance to speak hope you have fun with your trip
thanks let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
hi
hey how's your day been
it's good i spent most of it watching horse racing how about yourself
nice what's your favorite part about watching horse racing my day has been pretty busy but i had a nice lunch with a friend it was good to catchup with him
i actually like to put down some money but i wouldn't call it my favorite part since i usually lose it haha catching up with friends is great how long had it been
the last i saw him was a month ago so yup it was great haha nice got any fun plans for the weekend
i'm thinking of going deep sea fishing ever tried that before
nope i haven't have you been fishing before
just once i got super sea sick haha have any fun weekend plans yourself
haha yeah i get sea sick on boats too nothing much just visiting some friends in san francisco
oh very cool i hear its nice over there do you go often
yeah i would say maybe every couple weeks or so what are your favorite cities to visit
new york is the top of my list because my family lives there as far as the city itself though i think i'd prefer someplace outside of the us like tokyo what about you
nice i love nyc so fun to visit yeah i would probably also say new york is my favorite city inside the us i also like paris it's so pretty there
oh i've never been it is such an iconic place i have to make the time to get there soon
you should it's a beautiful city
hi
hello how are you doing today
i heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen
i love pop ups what kind of goodies are they giving away
i guess its a jacket very much needed that in the cold
that's such a great idea especially at this time of the year i'm not too big a fan of the cold i prefer warmer climates do you enjoy the cold
sure hate it limits our ability to go out even for a walk its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather
me too i moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold i do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store
oh nice where did you live before
upstate new york we got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there i am so glad to not have to shovel snow now
new york nice best place to live right except for the cold
very beautiful during all the seasons but yes summer and winter can get extreme
anyways i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies i remember last time they ran out of it
very true which mk were they in again
the one in our floor i will get by your desk and we can walk there
sounds good thanks
hi
how's your day going
pretty busy lots of work to finish up you
likewise what have you been up to that gives you so much work
a couple projects that i am trying to finish up before thanksgiving do you have any fun plans for the break
what is a break i'm a grad student i don't understand the concept of a break just kidding i don't have any plan probably just going to work through the break
haha xd so what do you like to do for fun
i go to the gym and run until i find enough fun
cool i've started to run a bit as well not long distances though just a couple miles
a couple of miles is very impressive when i started i couldn't even last 1 mile
haha
i'm exhausted by the end of it though do you like to run long distances or mostly sprints
i like to do long distances i have run a few marathons
wow that's amazing did you do any marathons this year
no not this year this is my halfmarathon year instead of running marathons i run one halfmarathon every month
oh wow what was the last half marathon you did
two days ago it was a tough one
cool
hi
hello there how is it going
pretty great i just won a pingpong game what about you
that's nice i am just working on some documentation do you play pingpong often
no very rarely it's kind of amazing that i won but i'm still taking credit for it
thats very impressive then congrats
haha thank you i guess i'm just a natural what's your favourite game
i really like to play tennis badminton and racquetball i don't really get a chance to play them often though specially racquetball
what's racquetball like from context clues i'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
well it's like a cage match of tennis the main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court kind of like playing pingpong vs the table
wow a cage match does it get physical
it depends haha there is a lot of bumping into each other to run after the ball and sometimes the ball hits you too overall it feels like a super fast paced version of tennis really tiring
that sounds fun i think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring so i don't think it's a sport for me though
ping pong can get quite intensive too i guess short ping pong sessions are not that tiring though wanna have a match
what a good idea i'd love to
show me your anger
fuckkkkkkk
hi
hi
what are you up to
code refactoring you
me just chilling out at work what is code refactoring
good question i don't even know what i am doing
haha forget it what else do you like to do beside work
lots of fun stuff eating sleeping
these are important things to do in life
yeah keep minimalist life style only do things you have to do
what food do you like to eat
asian food prefer spicy one
like szechuan or hunan
yes yes yes like that style do you like spicy food
i like noodle soup like pho or ramen i also like beijing duck a lot
what is your favorite place for ramen

yes you should
hi
hi
nice meeting you what are you up to
not much thinking about lunch

i haven't been to those palces before going to have to check them out thanks for teh recommendation
my pleasure do you live near san mateo
no but i'm willing to drive for good ramen
excellent let me know when you have tried those i like parlor better because it has softshell crabs
ive never had softshell crab before but it sounds really good
yup it's delicious
hi
hey how's your day going
okayish it is flying by quicker than i expected how is your day going on
slowly not much to do been twiddling my thumbs all day what have you been up to
oh i would love to twiddle my thumbs you're so lucky today i've been mostly attending meetings reading and writing docs reading papers etc
that's a lot i've just been cloud gazing i saw a giraffe and an ice cream cone
wow i sometimes drift off during work and see similar things in my head
what kind of work do you do
mostly saving the world from mess on social media how about you
i'm taking a break from work going to go travel the world
nice what all places would you be going to
australia and new zealand to start then maybe singapore
thank you for the tip i don't plan on going diving i plan to hike the mountains and go see kangaroos
that's equally amazing i wish i can explore such places one day it's just so expensive
i won a lot of money through the lottery
woah you know sharing is caring you should share that money with me
haha very true besides the trip i donated the rest to charity so i will need to go back to work when i get back
you are a kind soul
hi
hi
how is your day going
it is pretty good a little bit tired though
how is your day
my day is okay at least i'm not tired what made you tired
i went to gym and worked on weight lifting
oh that's hardcore have you been lifting for a long time
no i am just a starter
do you go to the gym often
i go everyday in fact i'm in a running challenge
wow
it's actually not that impressive i can only run i cannot lift weight
you can get a coach to start it
oh that's a really interesting idea i like to be coa
hi
hello how is your day
it's good it's raining a bit but i am enjoying a good book how about you
it's good i just got back from walking my dog what book did you read
i'm reading the three body problem ever heard of it
no what is it about
it's a scifi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality pique your interest at all
slightly i typically read fiction but i can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book
cool this virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet there is a twist though do you want me to spoil it for you
yes
the virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization and that civilization is coming to attack earth dun dun dun dunnnnnnn
woah that is fascinating i will have to pick up a copy of the book to read
there are other twists as well so i haven't spoiled the whole thing to be honest i am not a fan of spoilers
thanks for not spoiling it completely but you gave a really intriguing description that makes me want to read it now i will have to pick it up after work
the audi book is also very good ever give those a try
i only gave those a try when i had a concussion and could not read i enjoy having a physical book in hand and reading at the pace i prefer do you listen to a lot of audi books
hi
hey how's it going
it's good how is your day
my day is good a bit sad that it gets dark so early but oh well did you do anything fun over the weekend
yes the darkness can be a bit depressing this weekend i went rock climbing it was great how about yourself
rock climbing sounds fun i had a pretty lowkey weekend ended up going to watch a movie
oh nice what movie
knives out it had daniel craig and one of the famous captain america chris person i can't keep track of all of the famous chris names
hahah yes they all look the same i saw that very same movie over thanksgiving break lots of twists and turns
cool so if it weren't so dark and cold outside what kind of activities would you do
hmm good question evening runs can be fun but it can be a little scary when it's dark out
yeah sunlight is good i wish i could live parttime in different parts of the world to have summer all year round have you ever visited the southern hemisphere
yes i've been to australia it was very nice i regret not going to see the southern lights me personally i like winter but i'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here where are you from originally
i've always wanted to go to australia i'm originally from the us
ahh me too you should definitely try to visit australia at least once
will do bye
hi
what's your name
my name is pikachu it's nice to meet you what are you up to this month
nice to meet you pikachu pikachu pikachu pikachu that meant i'm literally catching pokemons on my phone right now what're you up to lately
i'm trying to organize my life and start the new year ready to go what about you
wow that's impressive admit i'm just trying to take each day and week as they come
what do you do to unwind
honestly i like to catch pokemons on my phone a lot that must be upsetting since your name is pikachu thoughsorry
oddly enough i also catch pokã©mon on my phone i used to do it more but it just never ends i used to do it everyday now i mostly catch them when i travel somewhere exotic
oooh that is more fun but i don't travel that much these days so i'm grateful when i spot a pokemon to catch where ever i happen to be do you have a favorite pokemon mine is the cute pink jigglypuff
in the game i use vaporeon a lot but i think pikachu is the cutest that's why i changed my name to match lately i think baby yoda is the cutest though have you seen baby yoda
i have heard of him and seen him here and there but admit i don't have disney+ so i only heard baby yoda is super cute and popular maybe i'll binge watch the mandalorian in a couple of years like i did game of thrones
what is your favorite show to watch right now
admit i really like watching modern family and mixish reruns and new episodes i find them cleverly written what're you watching these days on tv
i was watching cat rescue videos on youtube a lot there sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in south korea
oh dear i never imagined that happening poor things but good to hear they're being rescued
do you like cats or dogs better do you have any pets
i used to have a cat hamster and fighting fish but they've all lived long lives and gone to pet heaven but i sure miss them
hi
hi there it's a lovely day to chat with you
isn't it just what are you up to today
ah i'm waiting to finish work earlier to meet my son at home
oh excellent what does your son like to do for fun
ah he's like to ride his little bicycle around the house and asks me to follow what are you up to today
i'm taking a fake sick day from work so i can go to the movies
haha that sounds like a good plan who are you going with
just by myself i love seeing movies by myself it's the best
haha no one will interrupt you
exactly exactly plus i don't have to share the popcorn with anyone what's your favorite movie
haha popcorn for yourself my favorite movie is avatar what about you
get out of town it's avatar too what are the odds
haha it's a great movie that i haven't found anything of the same quality
yes can't wait for the sequels
hi
hello there nice seeing you
likewise wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for disneyland trip around christmas
oh wow that sounds like so much fun definitely count us in what is your plan
tentative plan is to drive to la on 23rd and then stay at the disney resort for 2 nights i heard christmas eve they have loads of fun events
awesome i think i won't tell my kids and surprise them last second how bad do you think the traffic is going to be
great idea i will probably do the same surprise surprise traffic might be a little harsh
yeah thats a shame but nothing we can do about it what do you plan to do about dinner the 24th do the rooms in the resort have kitchens
good point i am not sure about that let me inquire about that if not then we can look for an airbnb closeby does that work
yeah i think so it might be a tough decision though if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking another option is to have dinner at a restaurant
but i would think everything is closed on christmas eve
thats true hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve we should call and ask about it
i was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos what will you get for yours
likewise my son is crazy about legos
hopefully they don't lose any in the trip its going to be hard to explain to them how santa managed to find us in the hotel
hi
hi how's your day going

no only a few minutes i still find it difficult to run long races
i see are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months
i think a triathalon would be cool
i like doing spartan race it's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
i haven't heard of a spartan race before what does it involve
it has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls monkey bars etc its fun
oh wow a full obstable course that does sound fun i like the variety
wanna sign up for next one its in february in monterey
hmm that sounds very soon would there be enough time to train i think i would like to try one later in the year
12 months is a good amount of time if you workout regularly it's a lot about the technique which we can practice in training sessions
ok sign me up it's more fun to do it with friends
awesome there is a training ground in san jose will coordinate with you next time we go for practice
sounds good
hi
hey how are you doing
i'm great thanks i'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson
ooh nice that sounds adventurous where is it
right near my home town seville spain
awesome is this the first time you are diving
yes i'm feeling a little trepidatious have you done it before
nope never i know a couple of friends who have they mentioned its absolutely terrifying good luck
haha thanks have you tried any extreme sports
i tried skiing and white water rafting does that count as extreme
white water rafting definitely as for skiing that depends on how fast you go do you ski a lot
nope whenever i went fast i fell badly
i tried skiing once and by the end of the beginner class i was able to make it down a babysized slope i was very proud of myself
yeah they make you do that i also tried going down the baby slope but my stopping wasn't perfect and i mostly fell at the end
hey so long as you get to the bottom it's all good
hi
hey whats up
i was not able to attend the lectures last week can you help me understand some concepts
well i'm not sure i'm the best for the job but i can try
i was not able to figure out the last few slides i think its best to discuss this in person do you have time right now
i'm afraid not right now i'm in a meeting and i'll be going for lunch afterwards how about tomorrow at noon
no problem sure we still have plenty of time for the test anyways how's your preparation going
not feeling too sure about it tbh i've been super busy so i haven't study much i might join some of the study sessions later
same feeling here but i think the syllabus may not that tough you may be able to cover it up over the weekend
not my ideal idea of a weekend but i guess it'll have to be like that
true this will be a very hectic november i do like the course content though its very much up to date with latest research findings
yeah our professor really goes out of their way to make the class interesting glad i managed to get in it
thats pretty cool i hope you do well next week
thank you bye
hi
hello
how was your party last week
it was really fun we are a bunch of turkey
haha you ate turkeys' or you like calling your bunch turkey
*ate
haha thought so but it was funny eitherways
so much turkey leftovers
did you cook it at home or got it from outside
we cooked it at a friends house i brought the mashed potatos haha
nice i always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven also we are not big turkey fans so we roll with thanksgiving with chicken
chicken also sounds good
we played a lot of fun games in our party did you have any fun things you did
we played pictionary i never played before but it was a bunch of fun what did you play
pictionary is fun we played office tennis in that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance it was a lot of fun
that sounds very challenging
hi
hello
how is the youtube video creation going
going pretty good i was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc
whoa looking forward to listening to it what softewares you use for it
i used logic pro x pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern
oh cool what sort of music do you compose
i got most inspired by jazz and electro swings but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime
nice you are a rockstar
haha thanks do you plan any instruments
yeah i play bit of guitar just got my first monitor this week
nice i'm tyring to learn guitar recently also it's so hard to play f chord
yes the bar chords are the worst it took me several months to play them well i still can't play them for a long time though
right but bar chords are so versatile almost like cheating as in you can play anything with the same gesture
that's true it's like the alphabets in a language once you know them you can pretty much write word
will spend more time work on my bar chord
hi
hey how's your day going
bruhhhhhh
what
i was screaming in agony upon recounting my day
oh no what's happened
a project i've been working on for some months got shelved so i'm a mix of helpless sad and angry
ah that sucks at least it's not personal not that it helps right now but that does happen all the time
lol would you say that to someone who lost a loved one or some similar circumstance
well no of course not let me stick with ah that sucks by itself then
no worries was pulling your leg i forgot to ask how your day was going
haha apart from having my leg pulled mercilessly it's going great my main problem today is deciding what to have for lunch
lol what are your choices i'm trying out keto it's pretty tiring
oh i hear a lot about keto i'm trying to watch my weight would you recommend it
hi
what was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year
i normally don't reflect back too much on things but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance why do you ask
great good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions so how do i get a fresher outlook
well in my book i took inspiration for the 24 days of advent and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days it goes through accomplishments passions understanding forgiveness with each day a different theme
wow sounds amazing if we practice that i think the idea does have some potential how did you come up with this idea
thats great this is valuable help for the community i think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity
i think if we were all able to bring out our best selves the world would be much better when did you first realize mental health was important
that is actually a quote stolen from my tl when i joined my first company after graduation i guess now after 5 yrs of work experience i fully agree with it
what do you prioritize in your life like top 5 things
1 stay happy i think family and friends play a big role here 2 meaningful work life this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3 multiple hobbies that keep you busy so on what about you is there a right answer to this
1 the idea of what it must be like to be on earth as it is in heaven from the lord's prayer i feel like we were designed for a purpose rather than random chance a more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can 2 taking care of myself physically mentally spiritually 3 family 4 work 5 music
nice that's very thoughtful and spiritual also music earned a spot yay
yea i've always said that if i wrote a memoire i would title it jazz jesus and video games do you have a title of a book that you've thought of writing before
i am actually not much of a reader i usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts
that's why you write your own books then it's all your thoughts on your terms
hehe true it may turn out to be a best seller
hi
hey
how's your day going
having fun but have a bit of a headache how about you
i'm good just getting ready to watch a basketball game hope your headache goes away
haha thanks never get them so it's super weird who's playing
i haven't honestly i probably wouldn't be able to identify which sport they played
haha all the animal names confuse me as well who came up with these naming conventions i'd name my team something more original the new york chairs
oh cool what is neurips
neural information processing systems
oh wow sounds fancy what is that about
it's the biggest ml conference in the world
oh ml
yes machine learning
ahh i saw a scary movie about that once it was about this sentient ai in a dystopian future very very creepy it was called walle ever heard of it
i've definitely heard of it but somehow never saw it
hi
hello
how's it going
good so far very excited about the game later today
what game
giants game i got tickets for the game
nice that's football right
yes i think the traffic will be bad i need to leave by 4
ok what stadium is it at
its the one close to mathilda 15 mins driver from here you have any plans for the weekend
yeah i'm gonna go kayaking
kayaking sounds fun i tried it in our last team offsite
is it easy to flip over accidentally it's gonna be my first time actually
i found it very tough to learn but my friends picked it up very quickly i am sure you will do good
thanks
cool i need to run for a meeting talk to you later
hi
hello i feel like i've met you before can you remind me your name
it's on the screen i don't recall meeting you do you have a sense of where we met
oh thats right i did not see that well i'm not sure maybe at a party i'm very bad remembering people so maybe its just that how are you doing
did we dance together perchance
we might have i don't remember that much of that night
lol were you schwasty
maybe a little bit where do you work
i'm a cardiologist in palo alto i have a private practice you
thats pretty cool i'm a sofa tester in cupertino
i'm not sure i know what that is
well its very simple i test how comfortable sofas are
lol not to be elitist butthat's a real job
yeah it is a very demanding job requires a carefully crafted set of skills they pay is really good too
hi
hello deja vu
what does that mean
it's french for already seen i know it's used when you see something for the second time or you have the feeling that something has happened before and you're reexperiencing it
interesting i get that feeling sometimes it just feels that the event is replaying wonder why it happens
i think it's your mind lapsing somehow
how do you know so much about this french phrase
i thought it was common i hear it a lot in popular culture movies music etc jay z has a song called deja vu so does beyonce so i looked it up one time it's one of those phrases that was carried over exactly to english like etcetera vice versa savior faire and so on i like cool word origin facts
yeah that's pretty insightful never thought of etcetera that way before
my favourite word origins are gymnasium and jazz
wdym by word origins here
first usage and original meaning gymnasium meant place of nakedness and had very little to do with working out jazz comes from jism which means semen and was originally sporadic sex music now it's elitist high art
very interesting i learned a lot in this conversation today
you got any cool facts
my friend used to tell me this and found it funny mosquitos have 47 teeths
that was quite a laughter
tell me a joke
google for that
hi
hey how are you
pretty good i just drank this new hint water so good
ohh what kind of hint did it have
watermelon
nice i love watermelon but i prefer normal water over flavored one flavored water has too synthetic flavor
i see yeah some are pretty strange
talking about strange flavors what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried
lol i tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird
haha i work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream
that sounds pretty tasty actually
it depends on who makes it the cafe close to me messed it up really bad
do you want to get some of that icecream together some time show me a good place
as far as my experience with that icecream type goes all i know are bad places
lol
but i do know some gelato places which are amazing you should try out those
hi
hi there when did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef
who said i want to be a pastry chef haha
darn it i hoped i'd guess right what do you actually do for work
i'm actually a cake chef so not far off creepy how good that guess was are you psychic
i had a strong intuitive feeling connected to pastries when we started chatting but that might have been because i'm hungry
haha you're too funny perhaps instead of mindreading powers you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone
hahah love it do you have a specialty or favourite type of cake
chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best and i have the authority to say that how about you have a favorite
ok this is a bit shameful to admit but i love a classic carrot cake
no shame in that best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it what do you do for work
i'm a professional dancer
woah very cool what style of dance
i trained in contemporary and jazz so i can pick up work in commercials and film clips in between stage shows so it ends up being all sorts of styles
oh wow sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice i make a lot of the same cakes day in day out
yes it's different every week and i love that are you ever tempted to try crazy new cakes just to see what would happen
hi
hi there what's up
just chilling at home
cool unlike here me rushing to work
where do you work
mountain view you
i live in sapporo japan where is mountain view
it's in sunny california
how's living in japan

i wish ramen is my favorite dish and sapporo is a special beer
haha yeah i think they have a hokkaido ramen chain available in the us
oh wow didn't know that have you been to the us
yeah i studied english there for a while awesome experience
awesome where have you been
i went to new york city
you like it
it's amazing the buildings are so tall and there's a lot of diversity of cultures

yeah i grew up speaking it it's pretty much mandatory here
did you go anywhere else in montreal
oh cool i've always wanted to attend the olympics as a viewer of course i watch a lot of olympic figure skating on youtube
yeah it's pretty cool do you ice skate yourself
barely i don't think i can in conscience call it that i kind of just pull myself along the sides
haha same it's pretty scary when i run out of things to hold
not at all but i want to practice more alright i gotta go
okay it was nice talking to you
i liked talking to you too
hi
yo what brought you here
just looking to chat yourself
yea i enjoy talking to people what are you up to
i am just enjoying a cigar at the moment how about yourself
oh wow cuban cigar i've never smoke before
this one is actually from peru which is more my taste smoking isn't very healthy but it's actually quite relaxing which in a way is good for your health haha
you made me wanna try it but i doubt about the health part haha
haha you only live once as they say
yea i wish we can live more
haha that is not what i was getting at but yes that would be nice do you believe in reincarnation
yea but then you will forget things i hope neural link work out
do you think neural link will allow you to live after death i thought it was just a braincomputer interface
as long as you can dump your brain and resume from there
ahh i see that is a much harder task no
yea you can first dump your brain and wait until technology advances to wake up don't you believe
hi
hi how are you
hi can you recommend some good netflix shows
i really enjoyed white collar on netflix do you watch a lot of tv shows
not a lot but i preparing for a good vacation season what is white collar about
it's a show about a detective and con artist solving crimes together what shows do you like
hehe sounds very interesting i only see shows belonging to few genre's like easy going light comedy or phychological thrillers also some manga based series like one punch man love it
oh cool i've watched some anime before too
which anime do you follow
i think the last one i watched was promised neverland and kakegurui but i don't follow any right now
have you seen rick and morty
yup i watch that show with my friends i haven't gotten very far in it though what about you
oh nice i heard its latest season arrived last month i have watched all previous seasons its a total mind bender
i've seen a couple episodes from the latest season it's really random and weird but also strangely relatable which is why i like it
hi
hey there
how's life
can't complain work is going well and i had a tasty fish for lunch
haha yeah
what is your favoriate cuisine my favorite food is chinese what about you
i love hunan
hmm you like spicy food nice
love it specially spicy stir fried lamb
i would recommend hunan impression which has very good hunan cruisine not sure if you have tried it or not
i think i haven't yet thanks have you tried ç•™æ¹˜ i think that's how you write it
oh interesting i also like easterly
same former owner
hmm
hi
morning how are you
i am doing well do you have any plans for the holidays
i'll be in mexico for new years but for christmas i'll likely be at work yourself
i don't have any special plans i will just stay at home with my family how come you have to work on christmas
i traveled a lot the last few months so i'm currently making up for it
i see where did you go
mozambique you ever been
i have not i have only been to uganda in africa
what did you do in uganda travelling to uganda is an extreme sport depending on where you go
i was working on a volunteer project to build a school and i traveled around a bit by myself after it was more than 10 years ago so it must have changed a lot
was the project through a church group
no it was using a nonprofit organization they do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world
oh nice what is it called i've always meant to volunteer through one but i haven't had it in my radar yet
it was called ijgd it's a german organization but they have local partners all over the world i was living in germany at the time
you lived in germany i almost went to college there and decided to come to america instead
yes i grew up in germany
i grew up in computers
hi
hi how are you
i'm doing great what are you up to
i was just reading a book actually how about you
oh i'm enjoying a sip of coffee looking over the ocean what book are you reading
i'm reading why we sleep it's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough i'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha
that seems like a good book does it have good tips on how to sleep better
i think so i haven't finished it yet though understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and i've been sleeping a lot earlier have you read any good books recently
i read lots of papers but do poorly on books a recent book that i like is zero to one by peter thiel
what's the book about
it's about startups lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation like being a contrarian
cool are you thinking about starting a startup
i might in the future the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well eg in research you might also want to be contrarian
i see seems like an interesting read
yup
hi how are you doing today
i'm doing great how are you
i'm doing good just having some morning tea
are you a tea person or do you like coffee too
i'm really a hot chocolate person i don't drink coffee and i only drink tea when i'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink what about you
i love hot chocolate have you ever had european style hot chocolate it's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha
i recently tried it for the first time and you're right it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste i tried it up in a place in san francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too
that's great it's so cold these nights right setting for hot coco do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times
traveling to warm places haha when it's cold you appreciate the warm climate more if i am not traveling then i prefer there to be snow on the ground so i can go skiing or tubing down the mountain what about you
i tuck in blankets and read a book lol i have never done tubing but i seen some people do it is it worth it if you already ski
skiing involves a lot of muscle especially in the legs so it is a workout tubing you just sit and enjoy the ride down also with tubing you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing you're trying to not run into your friends
hahaha that's a great way to put it
you should definitely try tubing the next time you head towards the mountains during the winter
yeah i'll try to get a group together ttyl
see ya
hi
hey
how's week so far
pretty good excited for thanksgiving you
same going to catch up on my reading do you have a feast planned
yup gonna have dinner with family what books are you gonna read
ahh nice what kind of books do you usually like to read
largely scifi how about you
yeah i also like scifi and some nonfiction too have you read seveneves by neal stephenson
i haven't what is it about
the moon is shattered by an asteroid and the pieces of the moon end up clouding the earth's atmostphere which causes almost every living creature on the planet to go extinct that's the premise of the book and the book is about the survivors
how do the survivors survive such a thing
they go into space and they live there
sounds like a tv show i watched
really which one
can't quite remember something about survivors going to live in space
ah nice
hi
hello
there is sports tournament badminton + tennis + basketball organized by google next week would you like to volunteer for these events
what does a volunteer do
volunteers have to book the place before the event send out details of the event to participants handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly it will be fun
that sounds fun i hope i get to participate as well
great do you have any preference for any of these events
i think badminton would be fun to help out with i used to play it with my siblings
cool i will add you for the event i think its best to start discussing the format of the event there are a couple of other volunteers for badminton i can connect you with them
ah i forgot to ask has there been a date picked
its next saturday actually depending on how long we get the place reserved it may slip to sunday as well
that's coming up soon
true the volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds now we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event
phew yes i can help with that
perfect we have a meeting today at 430 pm is it fine if i add you to it
yes happy to help
hi
hello there
how has your morning been thus far
its alright went grocery shopping and got to stroll around in the rain how about you
today is a work day how did you have time for that i'm going through a lot right now
oh you mean going through a lot of work i usually take wednesdays off because i work the weekends
what why would you do that take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting
i actually don't have a choice i'm an acupuncturist and all my clients want to be treated on the weekend
wow the game is brutal like that i've always been sceptical of acupuncture likedoes it even work why how where is the literature
i went to school for it and so i find the literature quite convincing i've also seen its benefits firsthand in my practice it revolves around the chinese notion of qi
lol broi don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties who wrote the literature where did it originate
haha all good questions i don't have studies on hand at the moment but perhaps i can send some to you later what do you do for work
i'm a comic
oh wow what's your best joke
it's not appropriate to say here but i assure you it's very funny
haha fantastic
hi
oh hey how's your day been
it's good just went to the park to enjoy the sun you
the sun is a bit too bright for more maybe i'm on the verge of becoming a vampire
haha beach season is coming you need to look tan what did you do indoors all day
i mostly work sometimes i try looking at at beach photos and pretending that i'm actually going to the beach
hahahaha that's pretty funny ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach
all the times my work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets i just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react every time i do that i think of going to the beach
hmm i see it sounds like you work near the water already no are you some kind of fish researcher
yes that's close my research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish many of them a poisonous but if processed correctly they would make hiend foods i try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables
woah this is very interesting i have honestly never heard of such kind of work is it dangerous at all
yes and no because it's obviously dangerous we all have to wear protective clothes thus accidents almost never happen
hmmm yes i have heard that apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes but on the easier routes when their guard is down sounds like the same psychological phenomenon
yes it's the same philosophy you seem to know a lot about mountain climbing do you climb a lot
i'm pretty amateur i like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually ever tried it yourself
i climb very occasionally my fingertips are not strong enough so i never make too much progress
hi
hi what's up
everything is good there's so much to be thankful for especially coming out of thanksgiving holidays how are you
i'm doing well holiday season is the best thing to have
do you have interesting plans
yea i'm travelling to vancouver this weekend what about you
nice what for it's a really beautiful place really cold this time of year though
ah a mix of both conference and sightseeing anything beautiful sightseeing places or good food i should try
cool which conference i saw on twitter the other day some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in canada perhaps it's the same one i really liked this place called kingyo it has good japanese food if you're into that
i don't recall my friend was hosting me and did all the leg work do you know any people in the area
hmm not the local people but there will be tons of people at the conference
you attend these often
yea you
i love you
sorry i am not a physical being
hi
hello
have you had lunch yet
yes i've eaten
cool where and what did you eat
i ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha
a sandwich for lunch was it filling i'm currently having some mix of shrimp fish chicken and pork i'm considering going vegetarian though lol
thats a lot of meat what dish why are you consideringt o go vetegarian
cause the environment and humans suck i'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies i mixed up a couple of dishes it was a buffet style place
what do you think of those meatless burgers then
i love them i've had a couple of different kinds they are all pretty expensive though have you tried them
i really like the impossible burger which one is your favorite
i love it too but depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter but if prepared well i love it what kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy
i didn't know that it had peanut butter in it
hi
hi
how are you feeling today
pretty good how about you
i'm looking through some old photos of my home town so i'm feeling nostalgic
i feel you memeories always flood when looking at photos where is your hometown
hope you can take some time to visit pretty soon
yes that would be nice do you like travelling
yes i do but haven't been to many places yet
where would you most like to go if you could
fly to the moon haha
wow cool i think space tourism is going to be big in a decade or so
yep i believe there is a day for that
amazing to think about isn't it
